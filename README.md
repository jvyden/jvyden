# Welcome to The Worst GitHub Profile
My commits are always signed and show a Verified tag. If they aren't, there's a 90% chance its not me.

I create gists occasionally. They unfortunately don't show up here on the main GitHub website, so you can find them [here](https://gist.github.com/jvyden).

Most of my current work is done in the [LittleBigRefresh](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh) org, but I do have some personal projects here
