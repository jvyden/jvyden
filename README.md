# Welcome to The Worst GitHub Profile
My commits are always signed and show a Verified tag. If they aren't, there's a 90% chance its not me.

I create gists occasionally. They unfortunately don't show up here on the main GitHub website, so you can find them [here](https://gist.github.com/jvyden).

Most of my current work is done in the [LittleBigRefresh](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh) org, but I do have some personal projects here

## Random advice
### You are currently procrastinating
The best advice I can give is to turn around and go do some real work :)

### Everything is shit
Linux is shit, Windows is shit, macOS is shit, TempleOS is shit.
Rider is shit, Visual Studio is shit, Atom is shit, Vim is shit, Emacs is shit.

***Everything is shit, so use the software that's the least shit for you.*** If someone says the tools and workflow you've stuck to for years suck, then they're wrong because they're not you.
There's no objectivity in software choice. It's ***your*** choice. Likewise, other people's choices are theirs to make.

But just remember to experiment with your workflow every so often, that's how you learn! If nothing else you'll just like to learn your tools more.

### Everyone else is terrified
The maintainer is just as nervous to handle your issue as you are to submit it.
But you two have one common goal: making that software better. So go write that issue :)

This extends to life in general too, for example the cashier is just as nervous to handle your order as you are to place it.

What helps nobody is being a dick to people - we're all human, so yelling at people about a bug or a feature that should be added doesn't really achieve anything.
As a maintainer myself, a condescending tone is enough to make me not want to consider your report at all.
Likewise, I'll drop everything to help someone who's been consistently kind to me.

### Assume everyone else is as smart as you
Start your conversations about new topics with people by talking with all the technical details you can muster, as if you were talking to an exact clone of yourself that knows what you're on about.

If you're lucky, you find someone that understands you and you can start at that high-level language, skipping all that "dumbing down the subject" nonsense.
If the other person isn't really following or starts asking questions, that's when you start explaining it in simpler terms. Slowly bring the language down until they can understand.

Seriously, try this. You'd be surprised by just how understanding people in your space are.
If the other person is engaged but doesn't understand, they ask questions - and it can be fun teaching that topic to them.
On the flip-side, a smart person might feel you're coming off as condescending to them if you use simpler language in my experience.
