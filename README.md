### Welcome to The Worst GitHub Profile

My commits are always signed and show a Verified tag. If they aren't, there's a 90% chance its not me.

I create gists occasionally. They unfortunately don't show up here on the main GitHub website, so you can find them [here](https://gist.github.com/jvyden).
