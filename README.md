# Welcome to The Worst GitHub Profile
My commits are always signed and show a Verified tag. If they aren't, there's a 90% chance its not me.

I create gists occasionally. They unfortunately don't show up here on the main GitHub website, so you can find them [here](https://gist.github.com/jvyden).

Most of my current work is done in the [LittleBigRefresh](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh) org, but I do have some personal projects here

## Random advice
### You are currently procrastinating
The best advice I can give is to turn around and go do some real work :)

### Everything is shit
Linux is shit, Windows is shit, macOS is shit, TempleOS is shit.
Rider is shit, Visual Studio is shit, Atom is shit, Vim is shit, Emacs is shit.

***Everything is shit, so use the software that's the least shit for you.*** If someone says the tools and workflow you've stuck to for years suck, then they're wrong because they're not you.
There's no objectivity in software choice. It's ***your*** choice. Likewise, other people's choices are theirs to make.

But just remember to experiment with your workflow every so often, that's how you learn! If nothing else you'll just like to learn your tools more.

### Everyone else is terrified
The maintainer is just as nervous to handle your issue as you are to submit it.
But you two have one common goal: making that software better. So go write that issue :)
